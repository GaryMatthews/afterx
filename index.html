				<!-- 
				<p>
					Welcome to the world of IRC, and in particular, the AfterX internet relay chat network network!.
					To get onto our network, just connect to one of our servers with your favorite IRC client.
					To connect to a random server use irc.afterx.net port 6697
				</p>


				<p>
					To connect to a specific region, in North America you can use us.afterx.net and in Europe eu.afterx.net
					The main official channel of the network is #AfterX, and you can find some lively chats underway on just about
					any topic. Be warned that some of the chat can be of "adult" content - much of IRC is like this also. If you
					have
					any
					problems, you can try #AfterX-help where our staff will try and help you with any network-related questions
					you
					may
					have. If there is no response (everyone may be asleep or busy), you can leave a message in the channel.
					Since rules are unavoidable we do have a few of them. To review the do's and dont's when chatting on our
					network
					type /rules in your IRC client.
				</p>


				<p>
					Thank you for sailing AfterX, and we hope you enjoy your voyage!
				</p>


				<h2>HISTORY</h2>

				<p>
					JAN 31 2020
					MINDERASR STEPS DOWN
					After 14 years as chair and network admin Minderasr passes the torch on to gms. We are forever in his debt for
					keeping
					the network alive and will allways have an o- line waiting for him. Thank you Minderasr for your all you have
					done for
					us and the many years of dedicated service to the IRC community. 2006-2020
				</p>
				<p>
					JULY 05 2004
					XNET.ORG BECOMES AFTERX.NET
					XNet officially announces changing its network name to AfterX.net. After a majority vote the channel #Xnet
					should be
					made the official xnet.org channel, tk the current domain caretaker and current #xnet owner after it was
					passed
					on to
					him decided to hold the domain name hostage refusing to return it back to the commitee.
					Before connecting to AfterX you will need to download an IRC client or use a webirc site like kiwiirc or
					mibbit.
				</p>
				<p>
					DEC 1997
					XNET IS BORN
					Theoretically speaking, Xnet dates back to the late IceNet. Started summer 1996, IceNet had a peak of 15
					servers, then collapsed August 1997, after all the servers went into chaos and de-linked from each other.
					The night of the collapse, two servers - irc.dockernet.com and irc.webserve.net linked back together under a
					new
					name, Xnet.
					Since then, many more servers around the world have linked to Xnet, forming a worldwide global network.
					(in case your wondering, the guy who made the name "Xnet" up was chaos)
				</p>
				<p>
					All our staff are freindly and aproachable. If you require help please see our #afterx-help channel. We live
					in
					different timezones so the best way to get help is to ask your question/s and then wait patiantly for a
					response. you
					might want to go and get a cup of coffee or get some nap time in and come back and check for any responses.
				</p>
























				<p>
					AFTERX.NET
					AfterX is a world-wide chat network which has many benefits to the other small and large IRC networks. All our
					servers have extremely fast connections, low downtime, and friendly operators just ready to help you. We
					provide
					registration for your nicknames and channels, to prevent other people from using them, a memo system, which
					allows you to leave messages for people who are not online and will receive them when they log back on. We
					have
					been in existance for almost 24 years, and we have been faithful to our users since day one.
				</p>
